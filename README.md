A crowdsale is the process of raising capital by creating an initial coin offering, or ICO.
An initial coin offering, or ICO, is a fund-raising mechanism where new coins or tokens are offered in exchange for more-popular cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin or ether

A constructor is a specialized function that we can use to pass initial values to our contract. In the case of Kasei Coin, we can use the constructor to pass values for the initial_supply of tokens, the name, the symbol, and the number of decimals that are associated with the token distribution.
